# Repository Overview

This repository "Website" contains a collection of personal web projects. The
root hosts an HTML5 Boilerplate based website, documentation under `doc`, and
several subfolders with experiments and individual sites (for example
`websites/ToDoList` or `React-Code` for a React application).

The user primarily wants an overview of all included websites. There is currently
no dedicated translation system in place.

## Instructions
- Keep future modifications consistent with current file structure.
- When adding features related to translation, place reusable scripts under
  `js/` or the corresponding project directories.
- Use German as the default language for new UI elements unless otherwise
  specified.
